What Do We Mean By Confidence? 

On a scale from 1 to 9 - where 1 is low and 9 is high- how confident do you feel about the current state of your project? 

The channel in which you use the \`/conf\` command is the project which you are rating.

- 1 (PROJECT) - I have absolutely no confidence this project is on track for success. 
- 9 (PROJECT) - I have absolute confidence this project is on track for success. `;
